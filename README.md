Automated E2E and integration testing of Milo-based projects.

## Get started

### 1. GitHub repositoy 
- Scenario A : I / We want to use existing Nala repo, learn, explore and contribute to Nala test automation 
  - step-1 : Fork [Nala](https://github.com/adobecom/nala) repository
  - step-2 : Clone, and set the remote URLs (Upstream and Origin)

- Scenario B : I / We want to onboard to Nala for our application test automation
  - step-1 : Follow Scenario A 
  - step-2 : Your first PR should include adding your project folder(s) under features, selectors and test folders.
  - step-3 : Create your project `.config.js` under `configs` folder, and add your application url's in `.env.js`, thats it you are ready to go!!
  
    - Note: The folder structure in Nala is designed to make it easy to migrate your tests to your repository seamlessly when Nala becomes a consuming tool,
### 2. Nala Dry run test :
- Run following command in your IDE or VSCode terminal
```bash
npx playwright test -g@quote
```
- If any errors, then run following commands to install dependencies defined in the [`package.json`](https://github.com/adobecom/nala/blob/main/package.json) and then re run above command, now it should run the Quote block test scripts
```bash
 - npm install
 - npm fund 
```
### 3. Start Nala automation test script creation
Nala automation script creation involves following three simple steps.
- #### Step-1 : Create [`feature.spec.js`](https://github.com/adobecom/nala/tree/main/features) under the `features` folder and add test cases and data
  - Please refer sample template for creating test cases
```bash
module.exports = {
  FeatureName: 'Quote Block',
  features: [
    {
      tcid: '0',
      name: '@Quote ',
      path: '/drafts/nala/blocks/quote/quote',
      data: {
        quoteCopy: '3D is a crucial part of how we explore the brand in a digital workflow',
        figCaption: 'Benny Lee',
        cite: 'Global Manager of Experiential Design, Coca-Cola Company',
      },
      tags: '@smoke @regression @milo,',
    },
  ],
}
```

- #### Step-2 : Create [`selector.page.js`](https://github.com/adobecom/nala/tree/main/selectors) under the `selectors` folder and add selectors
  - Please refer sample template for creating selector page object
```bash
export default class Quote {
  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
    // quote block locators
    this.quote = this.page.locator('.quote');
    this.quoteImage = this.quote.locator('.quote-image');
    this.quoteCopy = this.quote.locator('p.quote-copy');
    this.quoteFigCaption = this.quote.locator('p.figcaption');
    this.quoteFigCaptionCite = this.quote.locator('cite p');
    this.sectionDark = this.page.locator('.section.dark');
  }
}
```

---

- #### Step-3 : Create [`<block_name>.test.js`](https://github.com/adobecom/nala-template/blob/main/tests/quote.block.test.js) under the `tests` folder, and add tests
  - Please refer sample template for creating tests. Also please refer [Nala onboarding wiki](https://github.com/adobecom/nala/wiki/Onboarding#tests)
```bash
// Quote block tests
test.describe('Milo Quote block test suite', () => {
  // before each test block
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    obj = new Quote(page);
    webutil = new WebUtil(page);
  });

  // Test - 0
  test(`${features[0].name},${features[0].tags}`, async ({ page, baseURL }) => {
    console.info(`${baseURL}${features[0].path}`);
    // test step-1
    await test.step('Go to Quote block test page', async () => {
      await page.goto(`${baseURL}${features[0].path}`);
      await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');
      await expect(page).toHaveURL(`${baseURL}${features[0].path}`);
    });

    // test step-2
    await test.step('Verify Quote block content / specs ', async () => {
      const { data } = features[0];
      
      await expect(page.locator('.quote')).toBeVisible();      

      await expect(await obj.quote).toBeVisible();
      await expect(await obj.quoteCopy).toContainText(data.quoteCopy);
      await expect(await obj.quoteFigCaption).toContainText(data.figCaption);

      // verify quote block css
      expect(await webutil.verifyCSS(
        await obj.quote,
        obj.cssProperties.quote,
      )).toBeTruthy();
    });
  });
});

```

### 4. Running Nala tests
- Nala offers a range of flexible options to suit your testing needs. Please refer to the following choices for running your tests:
- By default Nala is configured to runs all tests in parallel in headless mode on following browsers 
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - WebKit
#### 4.1 : Run Everything
  - Example-1 : I want to run all tests on all environments or projects on all browsers in headless mode
```bash
npx playwright test
```
  - Example-2 : I want to run all tests on all environments or projects on all browsers in GUI mode
```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```
  - Example-3 : I want to run all tests on specific environments or projects (i.e [milo-live](https://main--milo--adobecom.hlx.live)) on chrome browser in headless mode
```bash
npx playwright test --project=milo-live-chrome
```
- Note : To run tests in GUI mode , you append `--headed` to run commands


#### 4.2 : Run Test Suite 
  - Example-1 : I want to run Quote block test suite on all environment or projects on all browsers in headless mode
```bash
npx playwright test quote.block.test
```
  - Example-2 : I want to run Quote block test suite on specific environment or projects (i.e [milo-live](https://main--milo--adobecom.hlx.live)) on firefox browsers in headless mode
```bash
npx playwright quote.block.test --project=milo-live-firefox
```

#### 4.3 : Run Tests using Tags (@) 
  ##### Example-1: I want to run all milo tests on all environment or projects on all browsers in headless mode
  - headless mode
```bash
npx playwright test -g@milo
``` 
  - Example-2: I want to run all smoke test suite on all environment or projects on all browsers in headless mode
```bash
npx playwright test -g@smoke
```
  - Example-3: I want to run all regression test suite on all environment or projects on all browsers in headless mode

```bash
npx playwright test -g@quote|@marquee
```
  - Example-6: I want to run quote, marquee and accordion blocks tests on (i.e [milo-live](https://main--milo--adobecom.hlx.live)) envronment on chrome browser in headless mode
```bash
npx playwright test -g@quote|@marquee|@accordion --project=milo-live-chrome
```
- Note : To run tests using tags, make sure in `.spec.js` file `@tags` are specified 

#### 4.4 : Run Tests on my localhost (ex: @local3000': 'http://localhost:3000',) 
##### To run Nala tests on your local host, please make sure you have following configs set
  - Add your local host url parameter in[`.env.js`](https://github.com/adobecom/nala/blob/main/envs/envs.js)
    - `'@local3000': 'http://localhost:3000',`

    ```bash
        {
      name: 'local-chrome',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
        baseURL: envs['@local3000'],
      },
    },
    ```
##### Now, you are all set to run Nala tests on your local host
  - Example-1 : I want to run all tests on my local environments or projects (i.e [local-chrome]('http://localhost:3000')) on chrome browser in headless mode
```bash
npx playwright test --project=local-chrome
```
  - Example-2: I want to run all smoke test suite on my local all environment or projects on chrome browser in headless mode
